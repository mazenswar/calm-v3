🎨 Visual Design Brief — CALM Therapy Website Infographics

🎯 Goals
• Redesign website visuals to feel professional, credible, and holistic — aligned with evidence-based therapy but open to Eastern/holistic thinking.
• Move away from playful “brain character” illustrations, which felt cute but diminished the seriousness of the work.
• Replace non-functional visuals with functional infographics that:
• Break up dense text
• Simplify information for clients
• Build trust and credibility

🖼️ Style Guidelines
• Typography
• Titles → DM Serif Display
• Body/labels → Lexend
• Tone
• Calm, therapeutic, trustworthy, professional
• Still approachable, not overly clinical or cold
• Serious enough for mental health, but inviting and clear
• Visuals
• Use minimal, abstract icons sparingly to anchor key ideas
• Example: heart (emotional openness), wave/circle (new perspectives), triangle (reactivity)
• Keep icons simple (line style, monochrome, brand purple or accent tones)
• Avoid cartoon-style or overly playful illustrations
• Focus on clarity and readability over decoration

⸻

🛠️ Format & Implementation
• Infographics / diagrams
• Purpose: break up text-heavy sections and make dense ideas digestible
• Match brand palette + fonts
• Static graphics first (PNG/SVG for site) → easiest to implement, consistent across devices
• Optionally explore interactive diagrams later (e.g., expanding steps in the KAP journey) once brand direction is validated

⸻

📚 Content Types
• Summary Infographics (3–5 points max)
• For sections like Effects of Ketamine, Is KAP Right for You?, Values
• Step-by-Step Process Visuals
• For structured processes like KAP Journey or Investment Breakdown
• Keep text minimal → short phrases over paragraphs

⸻

✅ Final Recommendations 1. Icons: Use minimal symbolic icons (not illustrations) for accessibility and quick scanning. 2. Static First: Begin with static infographics to maintain clarity and consistency. Consider interactive versions later. 3. Simplification: Balance high-level summaries for conceptual sections with step-by-step visuals where process clarity matters.
