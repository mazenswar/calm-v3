Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP)

A grounded and integrative path toward healing

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) can be a powerful catalyst for emotional healing, especially when approached with intention and support. At CALM, we see KAP as one part of a larger journey — a practice that deepens and complements the work you’re already doing to understand yourself and heal. We strongly recommend a consistent baseline of care before, during, and after the KAP journey. KAP can be done on its own, but it’s most effective when embedded in a larger healing framework.

Ketamine’s effects can include enhanced emotional openness, reduced reactivity, and temporary relief from symptoms of anxiety, depression, and obsessive thought patterns. In a therapeutic setting, this creates space for new perspectives, deeper insight, and meaningful breakthroughs.

Our KAP Process

What to expect from start to finish

The full KAP process typically takes place over the course of approximately six months, depending on your pace and schedule.

If you're considering Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) with us, here’s how the process typically unfolds:

1. Foundational Therapy Sessions

Before beginning ketamine work, clients are required to complete at least six foundational therapy sessions. These weekly sessions help us build trust, assess whether KAP is the right fit, and lay a solid groundwork for your healing.

Minimum of 6 sessions (more if needed to establish safety and readiness)

Opportunity to strengthen the therapeutic relationship

Space to build coping skills and deepen self-awareness before KAP

Preparation for ketamine work, including:

Clarifying intentions, hopes, and goals

Exploring concerns, expectations, and safety planning

Establishing grounding and coping tools

Understanding the dosing process and set/setting

After your third session, if KAP appears clinically appropriate, we’ll refer you to our medical partner, Journey Clinical, for a comprehensive evaluation.

2. Medical Screening

All medical evaluations, prescriptions, and follow-ups are handled by Journey Clinical, a platform of licensed prescribers who specialize in KAP.

Virtual consultation to review your medical and psychiatric history

If approved, ketamine lozenges are prescribed and shipped to your home

Ongoing contact with Journey Clinical to adjust dosing or care as needed

3. Dosing Sessions

Dosing sessions are offered virtually. You’ll take your ketamine lozenge at home while on a secure video call with your therapist.

Sessions are approximately 2 hours long

You’ll be in a quiet, comfortable setting (with optional music or eye mask)

Your therapist will be present throughout to provide support and ensure safety

A trusted support person must be present in your home, available if needed

In some cases, we may offer up to two in-home dosing sessions at the beginning of your KAP journey. This will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

The first two dosing sessions are exploratory to find your optimal dose

After this, you’ll meet again with Journey Clinical to confirm the dosage and receive your remaining prescription

Clients typically complete eight dosing sessions in total, scheduled over several weeks.

4. Integration Sessions

Integration is a vital part of the healing process — this is where insights become lasting change.

After each dosing session, we meet for at least one 45-minute integration session, typically scheduled within 24 to 72 hours when neuroplasticity is at its peak.

Make sense of emotional, somatic, or visual material

Reflect on themes or breakthroughs that arise

Connect the experience to your ongoing healing process

Use tools like mindfulness, somatic practices, or creative reflection to deepen integration

You’ll complete eight integration sessions, one after each dosing session.

5. Follow-Up and Long-Term Care

After completing your full KAP series, we encourage continued support through therapy or booster dosing sessions every 6 to 8 weeks, if appropriate.

Many clients find benefit in occasional dosing sessions for maintenance or deepening work

Continued care with your therapist and prescriber ensures ongoing alignment and safety

Is KAP Right for You?

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) may offer a helpful option when you’re feeling stuck or haven’t found relief through traditional methods. It’s most useful for individuals who are:
• Addressing anxiety, OCD, or depression that hasn’t responded to other treatments
• Feeling stuck in long-standing emotional patterns
• Open to exploring altered states as a pathway to deeper self-awareness

We’ll work together to carefully assess whether KAP offers meaningful support for you. Our priority is making sure you’re ready, supported, and positioned to benefit safely within a therapeutic framework.

Investment

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy involves both medical and therapeutic services. Below is a breakdown to help you understand the financial commitment and plan ahead.

Medical Costs (via Journey Clinical)

Journey Clinical is a separate medical provider that handles all evaluations and prescriptions related to ketamine.
• Initial medical consultation: $250
• Ketamine lozenges (starter dose for 2 sessions): $97
• Follow-up medical evaluations: $150 (required at least once per quarter)
• Prescription refills (up to 6 doses): $163

Some of Journey Clinical’s services may be covered by insurance depending on your state and provider. You can check your benefits here or read more about coverage.

Therapy Costs (Our Practice)

All therapy sessions are billed directly through our practice. Some sessions may be reimbursable through out-of-network benefits; we provide superbills to support that process.
• Foundational therapy sessions (6 minimum): $250 per session
• Dosing sessions (8 total):
• First hour: $330
• Additional time: Flat rate of $165
• Integration sessions (8 total): $250 per session

Most dosing sessions last 90 to 120 minutes. The structure above helps you maximize insurance reimbursement while keeping overall costs more predictable.

Estimated Total Cost: $7,460 (spread over approximately six months)

Clients pay for each session individually after it takes place. There’s no upfront payment required.

We recognize that this is a significant financial investment. That’s one of the reasons we use a flat-rate model for dosing support and provide insurance-ready documentation for reimbursable sessions. We’re also actively working on building a payment plan option to make the process more accessible.

Clients who have completed this process often tell us that it was a meaningful, transformative investment in their healing.
