Section 4: Who This Is For
Heading: Is This Right for You?
Body:
This spot is for individuals who are experiencing financial hardship and cannot currently afford therapy. It's designed as a short-term, focused intervention—not ongoing open-ended treatment. You should come with something specific you'd like to work on, and we'll support you in making meaningful progress over our time together.
We especially welcome those who align with our practice focus: women navigating life's challenges, including stress, anxiety, cultural identity, relationships, and life transitions.

Section 5: The Process
Heading: How It Works
Body:

Apply — Fill out a short form telling us a bit about yourself and your current circumstances.
Brief consultation — If it seems like a potential fit, we'll schedule a 15-minute call to connect and learn more.
Begin — If we're the right match, we'll schedule your first session and get started.

We approach this process with care and without judgment. You won't need to prove your circumstances—just share what feels comfortable.

Section 6: What to Expect
Heading: A Few Things to Know
Body:
This spot comes with the same standards we hold for all our clients. We ask that you commit to the process and respect our 24-hour cancellation policy so we can serve you fully.
Toward the end of our time together, we'll work with you on next steps—whether that's connecting you with other resources, building tools for self-support, or helping you find a path to continued care.
