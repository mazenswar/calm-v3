				<h2>Is This Right for You?</h2>
				<p>
					This spot is for individuals who are experiencing financial hardship
					and cannot currently afford therapy. It{"'"}s designed as a
					short-term, focused intervention—not ongoing open-ended treatment. You
					should come with something specific you{"'"}d like to work on, and we
					{"'"}ll support you in making meaningful progress over our time
					together.
				</p>
				<p>
					We especially welcome those who align with our practice focus: women
					navigating life{"'"}s challenges, including stress, anxiety, cultural
					identity, relationships, and life transitions.
