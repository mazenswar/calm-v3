					Why Choose an Out‑of‑Network Therapist?
				</h2>
				<p className="why-intro">
					Therapy is most effective when you work with someone who truly
					understands your needs. In‑network options can be limited, and you may
					not find a therapist who specializes in your concerns. Choosing an
					out‑of‑network provider allows you to prioritize fit, expertise, and
					the quality of care.

							More Specialized Care
						</h3>
						<p>
							While some in‑network providers treat anxiety and OCD, these
							conditions often require specialized training to be addressed
							effectively. Our practice focuses on anxiety‑related disorders,
							OCD, and perfectionism, utilizing evidence‑based approaches that
							require advanced expertise. Additionally, we offer
							ketamine‑assisted therapy for treatment‑resistant conditions, a
							service not commonly available in insurance networks.

							A Personalized Approach
						</h3>
						<p>
							Insurance companies often impose restrictions on session length,

							best for you, rather than following insurance‑mandated guidelines.

							High Reimbursement
						</h3>
						<p>
							Many people assume out‑of‑network therapy is unaffordable, but
							some plans reimburse a substantial portion of session fees once a
							deductible is met. If you have a high‑deductible plan, you may be
							paying out‑of‑pocket for therapy either way, so it{"'"}s worth
							choosing a therapist who truly fits your needs and can support
							your long‑term growth.
