					Why Choose an Out-of-Network Therapist?
				</h2>
				<p className="why-intro">
					Therapy is most effective when you work with someone who truly
					understands your needs. In-network options can be limited, and you may
					not find a therapist who specializes in your concerns. Choosing an
					out-of-network provider allows you to prioritize fit, expertise, and
					the quality of care.

							More Specialized Care
						</h3>
						<p>
							While some in-network providers treat anxiety and OCD, these
							conditions often require specialized training to be addressed
							effectively. Our practice focuses on anxiety-related disorders,
							OCD, and perfectionism, utilizing evidence-based approaches that
							require advanced expertise. Additionally, we offer
							ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant conditions, a
							service not commonly available in insurance networks.

							A Personalized Approach
						</h3>
						<p>
							Insurance companies often impose restrictions on session length,
							frequency, and treatment modalities. As an out-of-network
							provider, we have the flexibility to tailor therapy to what works
							best for you, rather than following insurance-mandated guidelines.

							High Reimbursement
						</h3>
						<p>
							Many people assume out-of-network therapy is unaffordable, but
							some plans reimburse a substantial portion of session fees once a
							deductible is met. If you have a high-deductible plan, you may be
							paying out-of-pocket for therapy either way, so it{"'"}s worth
							choosing a therapist who truly fits your needs and can support
							your long-term growth.
