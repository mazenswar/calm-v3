					<p>
						Body Dysmorphic Disorder involves persistent preoccupation with
						perceived flaws or defects in physical appearance that are not
						observable or appear minor to others. This preoccupation causes
						significant distress and impairment in daily functioning, often
						leading to repetitive behaviors like mirror checking, excessive
						grooming, or seeking reassurance about appearance.
					</p>
					<p>
						What makes BDD particularly challenging is how the distorted
						perception feels completely real and urgent. The {"flaws"} you see
						or feel in your appearance can dominate your thoughts and drive
						compulsive behaviors aimed at hiding, checking, or correcting these
						perceived imperfections. This can lead to significant avoidance of
						social situations, work, or activities that might involve being seen
						by others.
					</p>
					<p>
						BDD often involves much more than concern about appearanceâ€”it
						typically reflects deeper struggles with shame, self-worth, and
						harsh internal criticism. The critical inner narratives that fuel
						BDD usually extend beyond physical appearance to encompass
						fundamental beliefs about being flawed, unacceptable, or not good
						enough in some essential way.
