				<h3>What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?</h3>
				<p>
					OCD creates patterns of intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive
					behaviors or mental rituals (compulsions). These cycles often leave
					people feeling stuck, even when they recognize their fears are
					unlikely.
				</p>
				<p>
					At CALM Therapy, we approach OCD with respect for both your experience
					and your strengths. Treatment is not about {"fixing"} you, but
					supporting your ability to navigate uncertainty with greater
					confidence.
